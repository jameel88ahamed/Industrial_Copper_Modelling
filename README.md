# Industrial_Copper_Modelling

## Introduction
The copper industry deals with sales and pricing data that may suffer from issues such as skewness and noise, impacting manual prediction accuracy. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and suboptimal for pricing decisions. Machine learning regression models offer a solution by utilizing techniques like data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, leveraging algorithms robust to skewed and noisy data.

Another challenge in the copper industry is lead capture. Lead classification models evaluate and classify leads based on their likelihood to convert into customers. Providing an application for predicting selling prices and lead classification can significantly benefit such industries, improving customer experience and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to build machine learning models for predicting the selling price of copper and determining its status as either "won" or "lost". The models will employ advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, rectification of data in incorrect formats, examination of feature distributions, and utilization of tree-based models, particularly the decision tree algorithm, to accurately predict selling prices and status of copper product.
